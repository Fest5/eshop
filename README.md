# ESHOP - Full Stack Ecommerce

Eshop is a Full Stack SPA ecommerce made with React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB and more. This is a technology store that allows clients to sign up and have an user, then they can add products to the cart, place order, pay the products and leave a review. There are admins that updates orders as delivered and can administrate users and products.

## API

The API contains orders, products, reviews and upload routes (the upload route is for new images on new products). It connects to a MongoDB database. All the CRUD operations can be done with this API.

## Front

The Frontend was made with React and Redux mostly, with the help of React Bootstrap for the styling. The design is minimalistic and simple. There is a homepage, a user page, products pages, order pages, admin only pages, etc. The routes were made possible with React Router.
